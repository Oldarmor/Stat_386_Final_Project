## Executive Summary

_TODO: Provide a concise overview of the project objectives, key findings, and actionable recommendations._

## Project Context

_TODO: Describe the motivation, stakeholders, and success criteria for this analysis._

## Data Sources

- _Primary dataset:_ [VG Sales Data](https://zenodo.org/records/5898311)
- _Supplementary data:_ `Scraped player data from Steam using a `[Github Repo](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/steam).`Because of the lengthy time scraping the data took, we have a file of how we scraped it and the scraped csv in the package.`

## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ `TODO - outline collection scripts/APIs`
2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ `TODO - summarize transformations and validations implemented`
3. _Analysis workflow:_ `TODO - describe statistical or modeling techniques`
4. _Tooling:_ `TODO - list packages, environments, and reproducibility steps`

## Results & Diagnostics
### Best Hyperparameters:

max_depth: 10
min_samples_leaf: 1
min_samples_split: 5
n_estimators: 200

### Performance Metrics:

R² (Test Set): 0.6604
RMSE (log scale): 0.1269

### Feature Importance (Top 10):

Rank – 0.2906
Platform_X360 – 0.1819
last_30_day_avg – 0.1439
all_time_peak – 0.0575
Platform_PS3 – 0.0537
Platform_SAT – 0.0359
Platform_PS2 – 0.0356
Year – 0.0319
Platform_PC – 0.0297
Platform_GC – 0.0287


### Interpretation:

Rank is the most influential predictor, followed by platform-specific indicators and recent activity metrics (last_30_day_avg).
Genre features did not appear in the top 10, suggesting platform and ranking dominate sales prediction.

## Discussion & Next Steps

_TODO: Interpret the results, note limitations, and capture open questions or future experiments._
