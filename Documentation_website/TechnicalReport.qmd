## Executive Summary

_TODO: Provide a concise overview of the project objectives, key findings, and actionable recommendations._
The purpose of this project was to see what factors relate to a video games sales. We looked at a variety of factors including the consoles the video games were offered on, steam data base info on the playerbase size, and the year that the game was made. We found that the three most important factors for determining Global Sales are the platform the game was on (being on XBox 360 Was really important), the last thirty day player average and the all time peak number of players on that game.

## Project Context

_TODO: Describe the motivation, stakeholders, and success criteria for this analysis._

## Data Sources

- _Primary dataset:_ [VG Sales Data](https://zenodo.org/records/5898311)
- _Supplementary data:_ `Scraped player data from Steam using a `[Github Repo](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/steam).`Because of the lengthy time scraping the data took, we have a file of how we scraped it and the scraped csv in the package.`

## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ `TODO - outline collection scripts/APIs`
2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ `TODO - summarize transformations and validations implemented`
3. _Analysis workflow:_ `We used a Random Forest model to train and fit the data, allowing us to make predictions about new games and see which features are most important in modeling a games sales.`
4. _Tooling:_ `TODO - list packages, environments, and reproducibility steps`

## Results & Diagnostics
### Best Hyperparameters:

max_depth: 10
min_samples_leaf: 1
min_samples_split: 5
n_estimators: 200

### Performance Metrics:

R² (Test Set): 0.6604
RMSE (log scale): 0.1269

### Feature Importance (Top 10):

Rank – 0.2906
Platform_X360 – 0.1819
last_30_day_avg – 0.1439
all_time_peak – 0.0575
Platform_PS3 – 0.0537
Platform_SAT – 0.0359
Platform_PS2 – 0.0356
Year – 0.0319
Platform_PC – 0.0297
Platform_GC – 0.0287


### Interpretation:

Rank is the most influential predictor, followed by platform-specific indicators and recent activity metrics (last_30_day_avg).
Genre features did not appear in the top 10, suggesting platform and ranking dominate sales prediction.

## Discussion & Next Steps

Because of the limited data we were able to collect on game specifics(game price, length, mechanics, etc...) we are unable to make concreate inference on what makes a video game successful. Further data collection and research is nessisary to make specific recomendations for video game design. Our analysis does offer some insights, suggesting that player count is a good indicator of a games financial success.
